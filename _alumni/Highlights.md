<h4><strong>National Service By LTA Nicholas Gan</strong></h4>

would unequivocally be running through your minds. If you are a pre-enlistee,

&amp; Television, Class of 2017), as he shares his NS experiences and insights,
thrills and spills! Also, take away many useful tips on how to survive
your Basic Military Training (and beyond), understand the expectations,

<p>Nicholas was awarded the NSF of the Year 2019 and served as Platoon Commander
