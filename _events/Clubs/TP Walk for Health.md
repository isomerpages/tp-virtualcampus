<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The <strong>TP Walk for Health (WFH)</strong> brought students, staff, community
partners and beneficiaries together over three fulfilling days. From <strong>28-30 October 2025</strong>,
this event transformed from a campus offering into a real-world representation
of what student life can be like, when community and well-being converge
for a greater purpose!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organised by the P4 Clubs, TP WFH saw enthusiastic supporters from myriad
walks of life clocking an incredible 12,170 kilometers over the three days
of action. Beyond the figures, however, it conveyed a more profound tale
of cooperation, inclusivity and practical learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Collective Effort &amp; A Shared Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the defining strengths of TP WFH was the way each P4 Club leaned
into its unique strengths while working towards a shared goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core walk operations were organised by the <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tp_csc/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TP Community Service Club</a></strong>,
which hosted beneficiaries from APSN, MINDS and Sunlove Chai Chee to walk
with student volunteers. Schools and organisations used live leaderboards
to track mileage, encouraging friendly competition and a sense of team
pride and solidarity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tp.studentsunion/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TP Students' Union</a></strong> injected
enthusiasm and vibrancy into the event through fringe activities, such
as jagua painting, live caricatures, food stations and lucky draws. While
collaborations with social enterprises reaffirmed the event's goal of doing
good, these options encouraged students to stay, interact and enjoy campus
life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an exciting host of gaming booths and inflatables, the <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tp_sportsclub/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TP Sports Club</a></strong> fueled
the carnival, creating lively areas and opportunities for the beneficiaries,
general public and students to interact via shared enjoyment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TP WFH's opening and concluding events were marked by <strong>Guests of Honour</strong> - <strong>Mr Aw Tuan Kee,</strong>  <strong>Deputy Principal</strong>;
and <strong>Mr Desmond Lim, Acting Director, SDAA</strong> respectively.
The <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tpadventureclub/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TP Adventure Club</a></strong> served
as the focal point of both the ceremonies and evening programmes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>TP WFH remains a strong and meaningful platform. The three-day format
with both indoor and outdoor walking proved effective, and thematic night
walks continued to be a strong and attractive draw for the participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, this event reminded the community that well-being is
not a static concept, but a fluid notion that is built through movement,
relationships and shared purpose. When the community walks together, they
do more than just clocking mileage - but also fostering understanding,
compassion and a campus culture that values both health and heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And at its heart, it is simple: <strong>people walking together, for each other</strong>!</p>
