<h3><strong>TP Walk for Health</strong></h3>

<p>Hey #TPFAM! It is that time of the year to lace up once again – only this
time, we are taking it up a notch!</p>
<p>From the well-loved TP Walk for Rice, we are back with a bigger and bolder
dream. Introducing the <strong>TP Walk for Health (WFH)</strong>, proudly
organised by the P4 Clubs in support of the South East Community Development
Council’s annual campaign!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine being able to contribute to a good cause just through walking,
so get ready to make a real difference. Transform <strong>every kilometre</strong> you
walk into <strong>$1 in vouchers</strong> for needy families residing in
the South East District, courtesy of the FairPrice Foundation! And since
it is <strong>TP’s 35th anniversary</strong>, let’s rally together and hit <strong>3,500 participants</strong> for
every amazing year we are celebrating!&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Where Fun Meets Purpose – Come Be Part of It!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Get ready for our action-packed event with both <strong>Outdoor</strong> and <strong>Indoor Walk</strong> segments.
Rack up those steps to stand a chance to win attractive prizes, and clock

<h4><strong>Join the Carnival Craze – Food &amp; Festivities Awaits!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Explore our exciting line-up of <strong>day and night fringe activities</strong> filled
with free delicious <strong>food treats </strong>(whilst stocks last), thrilling <strong>carnival games</strong>,
a <strong>photo booth</strong> to capture all your best memories, and more!
Catch the beat and feel the vibe, as our TP talents and community partners
light up the stage with their vibrant <strong>performances</strong>. And
