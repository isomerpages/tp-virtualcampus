<p>Huge congratulations to our scholars who were celebrated at the <strong>Temasek Polytechnic Scholarships Presentation</strong> held
on 27 January 2025, graced by our Principal &amp; CEO, Mr Peter Lam!</p>
<p>80 Year 1 scholars were presented with the premier <strong>TP Scholarship</strong> and <strong>TP Scholarship (Engineering)</strong> in
recognition of their outstanding academic results, stellar CCA achievements,
as well as their exceptional leadership and potential. 30 Year 2 and 3
student leaders were awarded the <strong>Daisy Phay-TP Foundation CCA Scholarship</strong> and <strong>TP CCA Scholarship</strong> for
their remarkable contributions to TP through the diverse range of CCAs
from arts, sports and leadership.</p>
<p>These scholarships are a testament to TP's commitment to nurturing not
just academic excellence but also the holistic development of our students,
as well as recognising their role in enriching the vibrancy of our campus
in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Keep pursuing your passion, #TPFAM!</p>
