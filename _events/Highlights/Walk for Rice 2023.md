The TP Community Service Club (CSC) is back with **Walk for Rice (WFR)** in hybrid mode and we would like to invite you to join us!

A collaboration between the Fairprice Foundation and South East Community Development Council, WFR seeks to inculcate a spirit of giving among individuals in TP. For every 300m clocked, Fairprice Foundation will contribute 3 bowls of grains to vulnerable residents residing within the South East District.

This year, WFR will feature a virtual and physical event. While you walk for a good cause, you and your friends can also participate to win prizes!
