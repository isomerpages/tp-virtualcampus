Heartiest congratulations to all our recipients of the TSEA 2023! 
The Temasek Student Excellence Awards (TSEA) are presented annually to recognise the inspiring achievements and outstanding contributions of students in non-academic areas, such as arts, sports, leadership, service, entrepreneurship, sustainability and character.

This year, we honoured 339 students across the Higher Award categories (Individual and Group/Team). 7 national athletes also received the Outstanding Sports Achievement Award for bringing honour to Singapore through their achievements at the 31st and/or 32nd Southeast Asian Games. In addition, 922 CCA Merit Awards (Arts/Sports/ Leadership), 348 Full Colours Awards and 130 Half Colours Awards have been accorded. On top of these awards, 2 officially-appointed TP coaches received the Outstanding Coach Award for their contributions. 

Here’s a special shout-out to the recipients of our pinnacle accolades – Temasek CCA Gold and Silver Awards! Hear their heartfelt thoughts and the memorable takeaways of their CCA journeys, and discover what inspired them to continue the good fight while navigating their ride in TP.
