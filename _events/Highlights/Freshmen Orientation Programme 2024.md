<p><strong>Welcome, Freshmen!</strong>
</p>
<p>Congratulations on your successful enrolment to Temasek Polytechnic (TP)!</p>
<p>The Freshmen Orientation Programme (FOP) occupies a special spot in TP’s
calendar. It not only celebrates a momentous milestone in your academic
journey as you progress into tertiary education, it also heralds the start
of your exciting journey of growth and discovery.</p>
<p>Feeling jittery before the commencement of Polytechnic life? Fret not!
TP has lined up an exciting array of activities to help you kickstart your
journey on the right note, and to support you in making your transition
into the Polytechnic less daunting and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>As part of the FOP, you will get to experience various onboarding activities
organised by your respective Academic Schools, which are scheduled from <strong>8-12 April 2024</strong>.
These activities are specially curated to optimise your assimilation into
Polytechnic life, while allowing you ample time and space to induct yourself
into TP’s environment, people and culture.</p>
