**Welcome, Freshmen!**

Congratulations on your successful enrolment to Temasek Polytechnic (TP)!

The Freshmen Orientation Programme (FOP) occupies a special spot in TP’s calendar. It not only celebrates a momentous milestone in your academic journey as you progress into tertiary education, it also heralds the start of your exciting journey of growth and discovery.

TP has lined up an eclectic array of activities to help you kickstart your journey on the right note, and to support you in making your transition into the Polytechnic less daunting and enjoyable.

After a three-year hiatus due to COVID-19, we are also pleased to reinstate the FOP activities in a fully physical format, where you can look forward to a better and more engaging Freshmen experience!

Some of the programmes that you can enjoy include the various onboarding activities, organised by your respective Academic Schools, which are scheduled from **10-14 April 2023**. These activities are specially curated to optimise your assimilation into polytechnic life, while allowing you ample time and space to orientate yourself into TP’s environment, people and culture.

During these activities, you will get to:

* Meet your Care Persons and classmates from the same course of study;   
*	Understand about your course and its structure, rigours and requirements;  
*	Receive your student matriculation card and learn how to read your timetable; 
*	Learn how to use TP’s e-services to access your lectures and tutorials; 
*	Enjoy a tour of our vibrant campus, including your school premises and facilities; 
* And many more!

Your onboarding experience will culminate in a fun afternoon out on **13 April 2023** at the **Temasek Regatta x Samudra** – a special finale programme that we have put together for you at Bedok Reservoir. You will get to watch or partake in exciting dragon boat races, cheer your hearts out for your fellow peers, and catch enthralling arts performances by TP’s very best talents!
