**Welcome, Freshmen!**

Congratulations on your successful enrolment to Temasek Polytechnic (TP)!

The Freshmen Orientation Programme (FOP) occupies a special spot in TP’s calendar. It not only celebrates a momentous milestone in your academic journey as you progress into tertiary education, it also heralds the start of your exciting journey of growth and discovery.

TP has lined up an eclectic array of activities to help you kickstart your journey on the right note, and to support you in making your transition into the Polytechnic less daunting and enjoyable.

After a three-year hiatus due to COVID-19, we are also pleased to reinstate the FOP activities in a fully physical format, where you can look forward to a better and more engaging Freshmen experience!

Some of the programmes that you can enjoy include the various onboarding activities, organised by your respective Academic Schools, which are scheduled from **10-14 April 2023**. These activities are specially curated to optimise your assimilation into polytechnic life, while allowing you ample time and space to orientate yourself into TP’s environment, people and culture.

During these activities, you will get to:

* Meet your Care Persons and classmates from the same course of study;   
*	Understand about your course and its structure, rigours and requirements;  
*	Receive your student matriculation card and learn how to read your timetable; 
*	Learn how to use TP’s e-services to access your lectures and tutorials; 
*	Enjoy a tour of our vibrant campus, including your school premises and facilities; 
* And many more!

Your onboarding experience will culminate in a fun afternoon out on **13 April 2023** at the **Temasek Regatta x Samudra** – a special finale programme that we have put together for you at Bedok Reservoir. You will get to watch or partake in exciting dragon boat races, cheer your hearts out for your fellow peers, and catch enthralling arts performances by TP’s very best talents!

### Temasek Regatta x Samudra

![](/images/Home/Regatta_2023.jpg)

Traditionally held as two separate events, our staple FOP highlights – Temasek Regatta (dragon boat contest) and Temasek Spectacular (arts concert) – will be integrated as one explosive and electrifying showcase on **13 April 2023**. Staged in an immersive format that is sure to entertain, this event also encapsulates the very best of our creative energies, sporting excellence and artistic splendour.

Presenting to you.. the **Temasek Regatta x Samudra**, a finale programme held specially for Freshmen happening in our own backyard – Bedok Reservoir!

**Temasek Regatta: Make a Splash & Have Fun in the Sun!**

What better way is there to end your FOP journey on a high note than by bonding with your peers and friends, while experiencing a slice of the campus vibrancy that TP is known for!

A time-honoured tradition in the FOP calendar, the **Temasek Regatta** brings together our TP family for a day of fun, play and action. Watch your friends paddle their hardest through a series of exciting dragon boat races, featuring both students and staff. Be stoked for your peers as they perform creative cheers that epitomise your School’s spirit, camaraderie and values, all in the name of friendly and sporting fun!

**Samudra: Be Dazzled by Our Finest Arts Talents!**

Another memorable experience shared across generations of TPians, the arts component of our FOP – **Samudra** (previously known as Temasek Spectacular) – will be staged as a consolidated experience for you this year, alongside the exciting dragon boating action that you will already be a part of!

A Sanskrit term meaning the “gathering together of waters”, Samudra brings together our individual unique stories through a specially curated showcase presented by TP’s performing arts groups - fully conceptualised, produced and executed by our very own talented student-artists. 

Be inspired by our collective values of strength, resilience, community and hope at Samudra!
