<p>Every year on 9 August, we celebrate <strong>National Day</strong> and the
momentous milestones we have attained since independence. It is also a
significant occasion where we come together to pledge how we, as Singaporeans,
will continue to build a stronger nation – for ourselves, our families,
as well as our future generations.</p>
<p>This August, muster up all your patriotic fervour, don your best red/white
ensemble, and be all set to celebrate Singapore’s 59th birthday! As part
of the <strong>National Day Celebrations (NDC)</strong>  <strong>2024</strong>,
let’s welcome an eclectic host of events specially brought to you by the
Schools, CCAs and Clubs across TP!</p>
