![](/images/homepage-images/1(main).png)

The Temasek Arts Centre proudly presents **“Tapestry Arts Festival 2023: Our Canvas”!** 

Happening from **31 Oct to 29 Nov 2023**, this month-long festival features the best of TP’s arts groups, as they converge and bring their own special ‘colour’ to a unique palette of artistic discovery and expression! 

A student-led initiative, “Tapestry” was launched in 2022 to celebrate the return of TP’s performing arts to the stage once again. This year’s theme – “Our Canvas” – seeks to provide a blank slate for all to contribute and build upon, and involves all 12 arts groups in TP as well as our two service groups (Digital Media &amp; Production Crew and TP Emcees). 

2023’s edition will see a total of 14 festival events, featuring an enthralling line-up of concerts, masterclasses, workshops and satellite performances. With the eclectic ensemble of activities across various art forms, there is a little something for everyone! 

Be witness to the magic that will happen as new colours emerge,&nbsp;possibilities open up, and inspiration grows.&nbsp;Come paint the canvas with us!
