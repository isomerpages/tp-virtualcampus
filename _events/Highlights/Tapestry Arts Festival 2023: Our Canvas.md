### **Tapestry Arts Festival 2023: Our Canvas**



The Temasek Arts Centre proudly presents **“Tapestry Arts Festival 2023: Our Canvas”**!

Happening from **31 Oct to 29 Nov 2023**, this month-long festival features the best of TP’s arts groups, as they converge and bring their own special ‘colour’ to a unique palette of artistic discovery and expression!

“Tapestry” was launched in 2022 as we celebrated the return of TP’s performing arts to the stage once again. This year’s theme – **“Our Canvas”** – seeks to provide a blank slate for all to contribute and build upon, and involves all 12 arts groups in TP as well as our two service groups (Digital Media & Production Crew and TP Emcees).

2023’s edition will see a total of 14 festival events, featuring an enthralling line-up of concerts, masterclasses, workshops and satellite performances. With the eclectic ensemble of activities across various art forms, there is a little something for everyone!

Join us on this exciting journey as the Festival unfolds. Be witness to the magic that will happen as new colours emerge, possibilities open up, and inspiration grows. 

See you at **“Tapestry Arts Festival 2023: Our Canvas”**!
