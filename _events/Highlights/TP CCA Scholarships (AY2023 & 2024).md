<p>Heartiest congratulations to our recipients of the <strong>TP CCA Scholarships (AY2023/24)</strong>!</p>
<p>Introduced in the year 2000, the TP CCA Scholarships recognise and reward
students who have made outstanding contributions to TP through their CCAs.
A total of 30 recipients – comprising exemplary student leaders from a
diversity of CCAs – celebrated their achievements at an intimate and heartfelt
ceremony graced by our Principal &amp; CEO, Mr Peter Lam, on <strong>19 Jan 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>These scholarships also reflect how seriously TP values our students’
total development as people, as well as their contributions to the vibrancy
of our campus. We hope our recipients’ accomplishments will inspire many
more of their peers to contribute, transform, and engage through meaningful
and exciting ways beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Also, here’s a special shoutout to our CCA advisors! They have supported
our students selflessly and witnessed their tremendous growth, guiding
them through both sunny days and turbulent storms. Thank you for nurturing
our #TPFAM to be the best version of themselves!</p>
<p>Keep pursuing your passion, guys!</p>
