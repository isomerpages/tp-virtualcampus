Every year on 9 August, we celebrate National Day and the momentous milestones we have attained since independence. It is also a day where we come together in a spirit of joy, unity, and confidence to pledge how we, as Singaporeans, will continue to build a stronger nation ‚Äì for ourselves, our families, as well as our future generations. 

This August, muster up your patriotic fervour, don your best red/white ensemble, and be all set to celebrate Singapore‚Äôs 58th birthday in style. As part of our National Day Celebrations (NDC), we will welcome a rousing and fun-filled series of events over the month of August ‚Äì specially brought to you by the Schools, CCAs and Clubs across TP!
