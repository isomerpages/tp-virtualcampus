<h3><strong>TP National Day Celebrations 2025</strong></h3>
<p>[Insert eDM here]</p>
<p>Singapore marks 60 years of independence (<strong>SG60</strong>) in 2025!
It is a monumental milestone that honours our shared journey, unites the
nation in collective pride, and inspires us to build an even brighter future
together.</p>
<p>This August, we invite you to ignite your patriotic spirit and join us
at TP’s very own <strong>National Day Celebrations (NDC) 2025</strong>!
Inspired by this year’s NDP theme, “<strong>Majulah Singapura</strong>,”
our celebrations will embody Singapore’s enduring legacy and a powerful
call for progress – one that has rallied generations to rise with courage,
stand tall with strength, and soar to greater heights with unanimous hope
and purpose.</p>
<p>Alongside SG60, we are also celebrating TP’s <strong>35th anniversary (TP35)</strong> this
year! The excitement will be doubled with a diverse array of activities,
passionately brought to life by our Schools, CCAs/Clubs and partners. Be
entertained with a vibrant <strong>Racial Harmony Day Carnival</strong>,
an interactive <strong>SAF60 Travelling Exhibition</strong>, an impressive <strong>military defence display </strong>by
the 23SA, an immersive <strong>gamified showcase</strong> by the RSAF, as
well as engaging <strong>fitness-themed challenges</strong> – and many more!</p>
<p>TP’s NDC 2025 will culminate in our <strong>National Day Concert 2025: “Confirm Can One!”</strong>,
specially presented by the <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/temasekartscentre/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Temasek Arts Centre</a></strong>.
Staged in a dynamic theatrical game show format for the first time, this
electrifying concert celebrates both <strong>SG60</strong> and <strong>TP35</strong>,
promising a memorable journey for audiences through Singapore’s evolving
history. Let’s unite in solidarity for this grand finale – both as proud
Singaporeans and as one TP family!</p>
<p>With endless fervour, boundless fun and unstoppable energy all round,
come be part of the action at NDC 2025 and experience the vibrant campus
spirit that makes TP truly special. See you there!</p>
