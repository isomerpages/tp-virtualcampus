<h3><strong>TP National Day Celebrations 2025</strong></h3>
<p>[Insert eDM here]</p>
<p>Singapore marks 60 years of independence (<strong>SG60</strong>) in 2025!
It is a monumental milestone that honours our shared journey, unites the
nation in collective pride, and inspires us to build an even brighter future
together.</p>
<p>This August, we invite you to ignite your patriotic spirit and join us
at TP’s very own <strong>National Day Celebrations (NDC) 2025</strong>!
Inspired by this year’s NDP theme, “<strong>Majulah Singapura</strong>,”
our celebrations will embody Singapore’s enduring legacy and a powerful
call for progress – one that has rallied generations to rise with courage,
stand tall with strength, and soar to greater heights with unanimous hope
and purpose.</p>
<p>Alongside SG60, we are also celebrating TP’s <strong>35th anniversary (TP35)</strong> this
year! The excitement will be doubled with a diverse array of activities,
passionately brought to life by our Schools, CCAs/Clubs and partners. Be
entertained with a vibrant <strong>Racial Harmony Day Carnival</strong>,
an interactive <strong>SAF60 Travelling Exhibition</strong>, an impressive <strong>military defence display </strong>by
the 23SA, an immersive <strong>gamified showcase</strong> by the RSAF, as
well as engaging <strong>fitness-themed challenges</strong> – and many more!</p>
<p>TP’s NDC 2025 will culminate in our <strong>National Day Concert 2025: “Confirm Can One!”</strong>,
specially presented by the <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/temasekartscentre/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Temasek Arts Centre</a></strong>.
Staged in a dynamic theatrical game show format for the first time, this
electrifying concert celebrates both <strong>SG60</strong> and <strong>TP35</strong>,
promising a memorable journey for audiences through Singapore’s evolving
history. Let’s unite in solidarity for this grand finale – both as proud
Singaporeans and as one TP family!</p>
