call for progress – one that has rallied generations to rise with courage,
stand tall with strength, and soar to greater heights with unanimous hope
and purpose.</p>

passionately brought to life by our Schools, CCAs/Clubs and partners. Be
entertained with a vibrant <strong>Racial Harmony Day Carnival</strong>,
an interactive <strong>SAF60 Travelling Exhibition</strong>, an impressive <strong>military defence display </strong>by
the 23SA, an immersive <strong>gamified showcase</strong> by the RSAF, as
well as engaging <strong>fitness-themed challenges</strong> – and many more!</p>
