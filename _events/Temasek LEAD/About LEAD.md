</div>
<p>The LEAD Induction programme was held over 5 runs for 415 LEAD students.
Participants used the DISC profiling tool to better understanding their
own and their teammatesâ€™ personality styles. They also underwent a team
activity that allowed them to re-examine themselves and their values when
under stress. The programme concluded with a sharing by invited guest panellists
consisting of seniors and recent graduates on their LEAD journeys.</p>

</div>
<p>292 LEAD students and 75 staff from various departments attended the Temasek
LEAD Heart that spanned over 2 full days on 1 &amp; 8 October. In this
run, 29 LEAD students stepped forward to co-create and co-organise the
event with staff, in which they also served as facilitators in the breakout
sessions.</p>
<p>The event touched on pertinent community issues revolving around the needs
and social stigma faced by ex-offenders (Beyond Second Chances), people
with mental health conditions (Is It Okay Not To Be Okay), special needs
(Walking with Autism), and lastly the issues on environmental sustainability
in Singapore (The Zero Waste Lifestyle - A Concept or Reality).</p>
<p>Participants were engaged in online discussions and sharing by speakers
from Singapore Prison Service, Yellow Ribbon Project, National Council
of Social Services, Singapore Association of Mental Health, Youth Corps
Singapore, Tzu Chi Foundation, Zero Waste SG including Mr Izad Ghalid (HSS/PSY)
and 2 alumni.</p>
<p>Based on students' feedback, the highlight of the event was the Human
Library segment which allowed participants to engage the speakers more
intimately in smaller groups. Our students were particularly interested
in issues concerning ex-offenders and people with autism.</p>
<p>At the end of the event, a handful of students signed up for volunteering
or student-led service project initiatives.</p>
