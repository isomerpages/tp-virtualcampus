The LEAD Induction programme was held over 5 runs for 415 LEAD students. Participants used the DISC profiling tool to better understanding their own and their teammatesâ€™ personality styles. They also underwent a team activity that allowed them to re-examine themselves and their values when under stress. The programme concluded with a sharing by invited guest panellists consisting of seniors and recent graduates on their LEAD journeys.

<h4>LEAD Heart</h4>

LEAD Heart (Uncovering The Hidden) seeks to expose our students to the lived realities and challenges faced by families residing at the rental estates. The event was co-organized and facilitated by our very own LEAD students.

Through an experiential learning journey walk thru the rental flat estate and empathy activities, students got to have a better understanding of the situation faced by the low income families. The event ended with a dialogue with Parliamentary Secretary, Eric Chua sharing his thoughts on poverty and social mobility in Singapore. We had a total of 200 student attendees who found the session meaningful and insightful.
