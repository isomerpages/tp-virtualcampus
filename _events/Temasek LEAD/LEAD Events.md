### LEAD Heart (Uncovering The Hidden)

LEAD Heart (Uncovering The Hidden) seeks to expose our students to the lived realities and challenges faced by families residing at the rental estates. The event was co-organized and facilitated by our very own LEAD students.

Through an experiential learning journey walk thru the rental flat estate and empathy activities, students got to have a better understanding of the situation faced by the low income families. The event ended with a dialogue with Parliamentary Secretary, Eric Chua sharing his thoughts on poverty and social mobility in Singapore. We had a total of 200 student attendees who found the session meaningful and insightful.

### Temasek LEAD Summit - In Conversation With Professor Kishore Mahbubani ###
**Has China Won? Implications of the China-US Relationship on Singapore**

We were honoured and delighted to have Professor Kishore Mahbubani, Distinguished Fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore to share with us his valuable insights on the China-US Relationship and how it affects Singapore and countries around the world.

The keynote address started with a poll with the following questions:

1.	Who started the China-US geopolitical contest?
2.	Who is taking the right course in managing this geopolitical contest?
3.	Who is likely to win the contest?
4.	Whose side should Singapore take in this contest?

Professor Mahbubani shared deep insights based on the given theme and covered the following issues:

•	Structural causes of the China-US geopolitical contest<br>
•	The mistakes made by China and US that have aggravated the geopolitical contest <br>
•	Who will win the geopolitical contest <br>
•	How do other countries view this contest, and what are the positions they are going to take<br>
•	What can we do to avoid this geopolitical contest<br>

Professor Mahbubani closed up the session by sharing his thoughts on the difference in cultures across different nations and how it affects decision-making, finding a balance on individual rights and collective responsibilities, appreciation for ASEAN, and finally advice on risk taking for Singapore youth.
