<p>Hey #TPFAM! It is that time of the year to lace up once again – only this
time, we are taking it up a notch! From the well-loved TP Walk for Rice,
we are back with a bigger and bolder dream. Introducing the <strong>TP Walk for Health</strong>,
proudly organised by the P4 Clubs in support of the South East Community
Development Council’s annual campaign!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Transform <strong>every kilometre</strong> you walk into <strong>$1 in vouchers</strong> for
needy families residing in the South East District, courtesy of the FairPrice
Foundation. And since it is <strong>TP’s 35th anniversary</strong>, let’s
rally together and hit <strong>3,500 participants</strong> for every amazing
year we are celebrating. See you there!</p>
