**What is Neighbour Cares about?**

Neighbour Cares hopes to build a community of volunteers to check in on seniors (**with a focus on isolated seniors living in rental flats**) regularly to monitor their well-being and take note of signs of distress. Akin to how a good neighbour will care for the people around, volunteers are to befriend the seniors and encourage them to be more engaged with their community. 

Come join us in our efforts to better the welfare of these isolated seniors and to meet like-minded individuals during your journey with us!
