**Hey #TPFAM! 👋**

This July, we are so psyched to welcome the Chulalongkorn University’s (CU) badminton team (Bangkok, Thailand) to TP for a Sports Exchange Programme! 🤝 Our Thai friends will be visiting under a Memorandum Of Understanding signed between TP and CU in February 2023, which aims to facilitate greater cooperation between both institutions through a multitude of activities. These include student exchange in the domains of sports, arts and culture, design, volunteering, medical and leadership; as well as staff exchange and the organisation of joint programmes.

As part of the Sports Exchange Programme, come on down to show some love and support ❤️ for both TP and CU! Catch exciting friendly matches between our #TeamTemasek shuttlers and Thai badminton players 🏸 – all in the spirit of sporting fun! 

Book your calendars now (refer to fixtures* in eDM below), and see you there! 🤩
