We are pleased to share with you this opportunity to develop as a **youth leader** through a newly launched programme by [Heartware Network](https://heartware.org/) (a charitable youth organisation).

On 12 Nov 2022, Heartware Network launched this programme, in collaboration with the East Coast GRC to develop 1000 youth leaders across 3 years.  There are 3 continuous development pathways provided for the youth - Learner, Builder and Community Champion.

In 2023, its initiation year, you will begin your journey as a ‘Learner’ by learning more about the community through your initial engagement.

You will be able to gain community awareness, community engagement skills and befriending skills as you uplift the residents and merchants within the East Coast GRC through ground-up initiatives and projects. These projects will fall under the three main categories of Care, Green, and Vibrant.

Join us in this adventure if you are an Eastie, 16 years old and above, interested and ready to **serve the community in the East** from March to Oct 2023. Thank you.
