<hr>

**1.   Can students be nominated for more than one CCA Merit Award (e.g. Arts + Leadership; Sports + Leadership)?**

Yes, provided the student meets the eligibility criteria.

**2.   Do I need to attach SEAL records?**

No, you do not need to attach SEAL records as the TSEA Secretariat will retrieve the students’ SEAL records to audit your nominations. However, please state the supporting events/projects/competitions (as per AY2022/2023 SEAL records) clearly in the nomination form.

**3.   Will I be notified on the outcome of my nominations?**

The TSEA Secretariat will inform staff of both successful and unsuccessful nominees.

**4.   Is an external CCA such as NPCC considered?**

No, only TP-registered CCAs are eligible for the awards, unless specified otherwise in the criteria.

**5.   How do you judge the scale of an event? Is an organiser of an Interest Group BBQ equivalent to an organiser of a concert?**

Some considerations in judging the scale of events include the number of participants, the profile of the invited guests, the impact of the event, and the magnitude of the event (e.g. nation-wide, poly-wide, school-wide, diploma-wide).

**6.   Can students submit the nomination forms themselves?**

No, nominations must be submitted by TP staff for all the awards (with the exception of the _\*Temasek Student Eco-Award_). Those submitted directly by students are deemed to be unsupported by TP staff and will hence not be accepted. Students who are found to have submitted their nominations without the endorsement of TP staff will have their awards withdrawn.

**7.   _Temasek Student Eco-Award_: What is the difference between the Eco-Green Award and Eco-Shield Excellence Award?**

All nominations will be evaluated by the Selection Panel. Deserving and meritorious nominees will receive either&nbsp;the Eco-Green Award or Eco-Shield Excellence Award, depending on the quality of their contributions/achievements.

**8.   Can a TP staff be nominated for the Outstanding Coach/Instructor Award?**

No, this award is only applicable to an external, officially-appointed TP coach or instructor.

**9.   How do I know whether my nomination form has been received?**

The TSEA Secretariat will send you an acknowledgement email **within 3 working days** upon receiving your nomination. Please email&nbsp;tsea@tp.edu.sg if no acknowledgement email was received.

**10.   Can the nomination deadline be extended?**

No, please submit your nominations by **5 May 2023 (Friday), 11.59pm**. Nominations received after the deadline will strictly not be accepted.
