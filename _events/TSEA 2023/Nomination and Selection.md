* Selection is based on a set of pre-determined criteria, which includes amongst other things, standard of achievement, attendance, level of contribution, scale and number of projects, and demonstration of artistic merit, leadership skills and sportsmanship.

* The selection of nominees will be left to the Selection Panel and the decision of the Panel is final. Neither direct communication nor appeals will be entertained.
