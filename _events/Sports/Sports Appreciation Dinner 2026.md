<h3><strong>Sports Appreciation Dinner 2026</strong></h3>
<p>What a phenomenal season!</p>
<p>Some 500 student-athletes, alumni, coaches and staff advisors came together
to close off a fulfilling AY2025/26 sporting season in style – and to celebrate
the contributions of the people in TP who made it all happen. This special
occasion was graced by <strong>Mr Desmond Lim</strong>, <strong>Acting Director</strong> of
the <strong>Student Development &amp; Alumni Affairs Department</strong> in
TP.</p>
<p>AY2025/26 also marked an exciting sporting calendar for TP, where we were
given so many reasons to cheer and unite as an institution! Our athletes
exemplified what the Team Temasek spirit is all about with these stellar
achievements:</p>
<p>🏆 <strong>POL-ITE Games:</strong> 16 Gold, 9 Silver 4 Bronze medals
<br>🥈🥉 <strong>IVP Games:</strong> 3 Silver and 3 Bronze medals</p>
<p>The students were also treated to an inspiring dialogue with two prolific
alumni, <strong>Kingsley Tay</strong> and <strong>Ardi Azman</strong>, who
brought their sporting journeys to life with candid stories of challenges,
breakthroughs and proud moments. Most importantly, they showed our athletes
that it is not only possible – but incredibly rewarding – to pursue sporting
passion with academics well.</p>
<p>Beyond the medals, we also honoured the unsung heroes behind the scenes
– our entire village of team coaches, staff advisors and fervent supporters
– who power TP’s strong sporting culture and keep our legacy alive over
the years. This event was also an opportunity to reconnect, build new bonds,
and strengthen the network that continue to propel our sporting excellence.</p>
<p>And to all our athletes: Huge kudos for your indomitable grit and undying
passion, and for proving how humility always leads to greater success!</p>
