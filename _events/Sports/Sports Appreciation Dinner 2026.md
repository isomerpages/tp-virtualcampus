<h3><strong>POL-ITE &amp; IVP Appreciation 2024</strong></h3>
<p>As a fitting end to the competitive sports season, we celebrated the contributions
and achievements of our student-athletes – present and past – at the <strong>Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE)</strong> and <strong>Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic (IVP) Games (AY2023/24)</strong>!</p>
<p>This special occasion was graced by <strong>Senior Director Ms Chia Li Hwe</strong>i,
with various supporters, partners and stakeholders in attendance. These
included our amazing and dedicated coaches too, who have been instrumental
to TP’s sporting successes over the years.</p>
<p>AY2023/24 also marked an exciting sporting calendar for TP, where we were
given so many reasons to cheer and unite as an institution. Collectively,
we recorded a commendable haul of <strong>10 Gold</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>10 Silver</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>9 Bronze</strong>&nbsp;medals
in POL-ITE, and <strong>4&nbsp;Gold</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Silver</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bronze</strong> medals&nbsp;in

excellence, for your valiant fighting spirit even in the face of loss/adversity,
and for making TP truly a home of the champions! &nbsp;</p>
