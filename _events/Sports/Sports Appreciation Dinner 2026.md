<h3><strong>Sports Appreciation Dinner 2026</strong></h3>
<p>What a phenomenal season!</p>
<p>Some 500 student-athletes, alumni, coaches and staff advisors came together
to close off a fulfilling AY2025/26 sporting season in style – and to celebrate
the contributions of the people in TP who made it all happen!</p>
<p>During the season, our athletes exemplified what the Team Temasek spirit
is all about with these stellar achievements:</p>
<p>🏆 <strong>POL-ITE Games:</strong> 16 Gold, 9 Silver 4 Bronze medals – Keeping
TP at the top since 2010
<br>🥈🥉 <strong>IVP Games:</strong> 3 Silver and 3 Bronze medals – Battling
heavyweight opponents and never backing down despite the odds</p>
<p>Beyond the medals, we also honoured the unsung heroes behind the scenes
– our entire village of team coaches, staff advisors and fervent supporters
– who power TP’s strong sporting culture and keep our legacy very much
alive over the years. This event was also an opportunity to reconnect,
build new bonds, and strengthen the network that continue to propel our
sporting excellence.</p>
<p>And to all our athletes: Huge kudos for your indomitable grit and undying
passion, and for proving how humility always leads to greater success!</p>
