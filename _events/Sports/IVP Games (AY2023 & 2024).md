<h3><strong>Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic Games (AY2023/24)</strong></h3>
<p>Team Temasek has given us so many reasons to cheer and unite at the recently
concluded <strong>Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic (IVP) Games (AY2023/24)</strong>!</p>
<p>Throughout the action-packed season, close to <strong>300</strong> student-athletes
gave their all and put up a spirited showing against many heavyweight opponents
across <strong>22</strong> sports. Collectively, their efforts brought home <strong>4 </strong>gold, <strong>1</strong> silver
and <strong>3</strong> bronze medals for TP. We are so proud of all our teams!</p>
<p><strong>Here are some notable highlights of this season:</strong>
</p>
<p>✨ Huge kudos to the <strong>Floorball Women’s team <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tpfloorball/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">@tpfloorball</a></strong>,
who finally managed to capture their elusive gold medal since the sport’s
introduction to the IVP Games in 2003. After 20 years of heartfelt endeavour,
congrats to the team for successfully recording their name in the book
of IVP champions!</p>
<p>✨ After three years of absence, our <strong>Soccer Men’s team <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tp_msoccer/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">@tp_msoccer</a></strong> are
SR Nathan Cup Champions once more! Reclaiming this coveted title was especially
sweet for the team, who had to face many challenging and hard-fought battles
before making it to the top of the podium. Bravo!&nbsp;</p>
<p>✨ <strong>Our Swimming team <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tplsst/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">@tplsst</a></strong> was
not to be outdone either! The swimmers glided their way to a triumphant
overall champion title, making it TP’s second consecutive year of clinching
this honour. Way to go!</p>
<p>Big props to #TeamTemasek for navigating the IVP journey with tenacity,
pride and humility, and for making TP truly a home of champions. Massive
thanks to all our amazing coaches and dedicated staff advisors too, for
working tirelessly to nurture our student-athletes to become the best versions
of themselves!</p>
<p>Keep fighting and reaching for the sporting stars!</p>
