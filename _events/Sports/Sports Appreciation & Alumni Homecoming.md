As a fitting end to the competitive sports season (POL-ITE and IVP Games AY22/23), we celebrated the efforts, achievements and victories of our athletes – present and past – at the Sports Appreciation & Alumni Homecoming 2023! 

This special occasion was graced by our Principal & CEO, Mr Peter Lam, with various supporters, partners and stakeholders in attendance. These included our amazing and dedicated sports coaches too, who have been instrumental to TP’s sporting success over the years.
 
AY22/23 also marked an exciting sporting calendar for TP, where we finally saw the full-scale resumption of the POL-ITE and IVP Games since the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to this link for the results and highlights of the Games!
 
Kudos to all our student-athletes for your commitment to sporting excellence, for your fighting spirit even in the face of loss/adversity, and importantly, for demonstrating how humility always leads to greater success!
