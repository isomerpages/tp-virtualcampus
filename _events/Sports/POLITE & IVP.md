### Polytechnic-ITE &amp; Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic Games (AY22/23)

Heartiest congratulations to our Team Temasek student-athletes, who have done TP proud with their strong and spirited performances at the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic (IVP) Games (AY22/23)!

This academic year also marked an exciting sporting calendar for TP, where we finally saw the full-scale resumption of the POL-ITE and IVP Games since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At the POL-ITE Games, Team Temasek gave us many reasons to cheer and unite as an institution, recording an impressive medal haul of **15 Gold, 8 Silver and 6 Bronze** medals. At the IVP Games, our teams gave it their all against many heavyweight opponents, where they brought home **4 Gold, 3 Silver and 1 Bronze** medals. Well done!

Our student-athletes’ tremendous feat is a testament to the power of teamwork, the tenacity of the human spirit, and the indomitable grit to overcome. Importantly, it is also about navigating the journey with pride and humility, and embracing the good, the bad and everything in between – while always keeping the end goal in sight. 

Thank you for flying the TP flag high, and for making TP truly a #tphomeofchamps. Onwards and upwards to greater heights, Team Temasek!
