### Polytechnic-ITE Games (AY23/24)

Heartiest congratulations to our committed student-athletes from Team Temasek, who flew the TP flag high with their strong and spirited performances at the recently concluded Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Games 2023! 

Throughout the grueling but fruitful season, TP recorded a commendable haul of&nbsp;**11 Gold**, **10 Silver** and **9 Bronze** medals. Well done to all our sportsmen and sportswomen!

✨ Hats off to our 10-Pin Bowling (Men), Dragon Boat (Men, Women and Mixed), Swimming (Men), Taekwondo and Volleyball (Men and Women) teams, who successfully defended their championship titles.&nbsp;

✨ Also, our Men’s 10-Pin Bowling and Archery teams both clinched their first championships in a decade, and the Men’s Table Tennis team claimed their first title in eight years too.

Thank you Team Temasek, for navigating the POL-ITE journey with tenacity, pride and humility, and for truly embracing the meaning of teamwork making the dream work. Most of all, big props for giving us many reasons to cheer and unite as a TP family! 

Keep reaching for the stars!
