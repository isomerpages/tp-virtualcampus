<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>At Temasek Polytechnic, we believe that talent should be nurtured, and
every student deserves opportunities to achieve their personal best. The <strong>Temasek LEADership Programme (Temasek LEAD)</strong> embodies
this belief. As an inclusive talent development programme for promising
students, Temasek LEAD participants can look forward to an amazing journey
of self-discovery and enjoy exciting experiences that extend beyond the
classroom and academic pursuits.</p>
<h3><strong>Aims of Temasek LEAD</strong></h3>
<p>Temasek LEAD<strong> </strong>aims to foster individual growth in the
leadership domains of <strong>Personal &amp; Team Leadership</strong>, <strong>Community Leadership</strong>,
and <strong>Global Perspectives</strong>. This is achieved through a series
of unique, interactive and exciting activities such as overseas engagement
study trips, community service projects, local and overseas adventure expeditions,
and leadership forums.</p>
<p>Temasek LEAD participants will be equipped with the leadership competencies
needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, transforming
into the next generation of leaders with vision, character, and a heart
to serve others.</p>

</div>
<p>The LEAD Induction programme was held over 5 runs for 415 LEAD students.
Participants used the DISC profiling tool to better understanding their
own and their teammatesâ€™ personality styles. They also underwent a team
activity that allowed them to re-examine themselves and their values when
under stress. The programme concluded with a sharing by invited guest panellists
consisting of seniors and recent graduates on their LEAD journeys.</p>

</div>
<p>292 LEAD students and 75 staff from various departments attended the Temasek
LEAD Heart that spanned over 2 full days on 1 &amp; 8 October. In this
run, 29 LEAD students stepped forward to co-create and co-organise the
event with staff, in which they also served as facilitators in the breakout
sessions.</p>
<p>The event touched on pertinent community issues revolving around the needs
and social stigma faced by ex-offenders (Beyond Second Chances), people
with mental health conditions (Is It Okay Not To Be Okay), special needs
(Walking with Autism), and lastly the issues on environmental sustainability
in Singapore (The Zero Waste Lifestyle - A Concept or Reality).</p>
<p>Participants were engaged in online discussions and sharing by speakers
from Singapore Prison Service, Yellow Ribbon Project, National Council
of Social Services, Singapore Association of Mental Health, Youth Corps
Singapore, Tzu Chi Foundation, Zero Waste SG including Mr Izad Ghalid (HSS/PSY)
and 2 alumni.</p>
<p>Based on students' feedback, the highlight of the event was the Human
Library segment which allowed participants to engage the speakers more
intimately in smaller groups. Our students were particularly interested
in issues concerning ex-offenders and people with autism.</p>
<p>At the end of the event, a handful of students signed up for volunteering
or student-led service project initiatives.</p>
