<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>At Temasek Polytechnic, we believe that talent should be nurtured, and
every student deserves opportunities to achieve their personal best. The <strong>Temasek LEADership Programme (Temasek LEAD)</strong> embodies
this belief. As an inclusive talent development programme for promising
students, Temasek LEAD participants can look forward to an amazing journey
of self-discovery and enjoy exciting experiences that extend beyond the
classroom and academic pursuits.</p>
<h4><strong>Aims of Temasek LEAD</strong></h4>
<p>Temasek LEAD<strong> </strong>aims to foster individual growth in the
leadership domains of <strong>Personal &amp; Team Leadership</strong>, <strong>Community Leadership</strong>,
and <strong>Global Perspectives</strong>. This is achieved through a series
of unique, interactive and exciting activities such as overseas engagement
study trips, community service projects, local and overseas adventure expeditions,
and leadership forums.</p>
<p>Temasek LEAD participants will be equipped with the leadership competencies
needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, transforming
into the next generation of leaders with vision, character, and a heart
to serve others.</p>
