The Temasek Student Excellence Awards (TSEA) are presented annually to recognise the inspiring achievements and outstanding contributions of students in non-academic areas, such as the arts, sports, leadership, service, entrepreneurship and character excellence.

2021 has been a continuation of an unprecedented year, when COVID-19 first struck Singapore. However, despite the many curveballs thrown by the pandemic, our students have remained resilient and positive, made significant efforts to keep their CCA groups alive, and devised creative workarounds in ways previously unimaginable. In the process, they were also engaged and exposed to new skills and learning opportunities. 

In the spirit of celebrating excellent student contributions, we are happy to announce that nominations for the TSEA are now open! Besides reinstating the full suite of awards that was suspended last year due to the pandemic, there are also two new awards up for nomination (more details below).
 
Do take a moment to uplift your students' spirits, and give them a pat on the back for their amazing dedication, selfless sacrifice and inspiring leadership.

Nominate them for the TSEA today!

**Announcement**

* Selection is based on a set of pre-determined criteria, which includes amongst other things, standard of achievement, attendance, level of contribution, scale and number of projects, and demonstration of artistic merit, leadership skills and sportsmanship.
* The selection of nominees will be left to the Selection Panel and the decision of the Panel is final. Neither direct communication nor appeals will be entertained.
