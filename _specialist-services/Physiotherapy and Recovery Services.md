As an athlete, getting injured will affect peak performance in competitions and can be devastating emotionally. To further support our athletes during the POL-ITE and IVP season, physiotherapy services have been specially arranged to provide relief and restoration for our athletes. 

Many of our athletes have benefitted from Mr Trevor Lee, an Allied Health Professional Council (AHPC) certified physiotherapist, and his team. With his vast experience in sports rehabilitation, students were able to increase their range of motion, relieve pain and acquire new knowledge on effective home exercises to accelerate their recovery from injuries.  

Some of the services rendered include: 
* Acupuncture
* Education
* Foam Rolling 
* Massage
* Taping
* Traction
* Ultrasound 

Services are offered during the POL-ITE and IVP season (AY2022/2023) as follows:
* When: Monday, Wednesday & Friday (During competition seasons)
* Time: 5.30pm â€“ 9.30pm 
* Venue: Sports Recovery Room @ Blk 29
* Appointment: Bookings to be made through your CCA Advisors for AY2022/2023

Arrangements for Ice Bath can also be made through your CCA Advisors and are available on a first-come, first-served basis. This is especially useful for teams that are involved in high intensity sports with little recovery time between games.
