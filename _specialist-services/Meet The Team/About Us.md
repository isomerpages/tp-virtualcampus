The Sports Division of SDAA in Temasek Polytechnic (TP) is the gateway to sporting activities for students in TP. From organising large-scale community events to promoting health, exercise and active fun among students, to developing high performance sports teams, you will find us there.

Over many years of discipline and diligence, TP has achieved excellent results in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic (IVP) Games, making us the best performing polytechnic in medal tally for a decade from 2010 to 2019.  With dedication and commitment, our Sports teams have brought much cheer, honour and pride to TP.  To all the athletes who have journeyed with us, a big THANK YOU to you!

In our never-ending quest to better ourselves, we are not resting on our laurels.  In the hiatus years of 2020 to 2021 due to COVID-19, we took the opportunity to review how else we can enhance your growth and development, as an athlete, as a unique individual, and as a servant-leader in the community.

We are committed to bringing out the fullest potential in each student athlete who has joined the TP family.  Athlete performance testing and services have been set up for you.  We aim to help you to achieve better sporting performance through critical feedback that matters most, complemented by purposeful and timely interventions to your training programme.  We work closely with your coaches and the team to understand your needs and concerns so as to bring out the very best in you and the team.
