The Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test, otherwise known as YYIR Test, examines an athleteâ€™s capacity to perform repetitive high-intensity aerobic exercise. The YYIR Level 1 involves running between 2 cones, beginning at 10km/hr, with a 10 seconds rest in between each shuttle. Speed increases over time and the test is stopped when the athlete misses the cones for two consecutive times.

YYIR test have been shown to be a valid and reliable predictor of high-intensity aerobic capacity and VO2 max amongst athletes from various sports and competition-levels.  This test is a suitable assessment tool for athletes who compete in sports that requires repeated high-intensity aerobic work.
