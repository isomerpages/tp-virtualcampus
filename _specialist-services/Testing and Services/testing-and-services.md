Perfomance testing and monitoring can allowed the athlete or team to know where he/she is in relation to himself/herself or by comparing with other athletes who plays in a similar role/capacity.  

Sports teams may arrange for performance testing suitable for your team through your advisor.  We also work with the coaches and captains to recommend training programmes to enhance ahletes' performance.

Services such as taping, icebath, sports massage and physiotheraphy sessions are also arranged seasonally to meet the athletes' needs.

Find out what each of the testing is used for and what services your team may need.
