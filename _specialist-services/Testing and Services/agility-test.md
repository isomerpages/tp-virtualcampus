The Illionois Agliity test is used to assess agility by measuring the fastest possible time taken to complete a 10m x 5m route, involving acceleration and multiple change of direction through a set of cones.

This test is a suitable assessment tool for athletes that compete in sports requiring frequent change of direction at high speed.
