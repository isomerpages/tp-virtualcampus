SDAA conducts workshops periodically to empower athletes with more knowledge to make informed training plans.  There is a range of workshops that caters to every team's needs. Customised workshops can also be arranged for a team, after discussion with the coach and athletes.   

If you had missed taking notes from the workshops we had conducted, fear not! We will upload the resources here for your review.
