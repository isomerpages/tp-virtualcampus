Periodisation is a structured training plan that allows an athlete to attain peak performance at the right time.  There are three broad phases in periodization that an athlete should consider: General Preparation phase, Competition phase and Transition phase.  

Having a good understanding of the purpose of each phase and how to customize it for the athlete (including your individual needs, school calender etc) is essential to managing fatigue and peaking at the key competitions.

Take a look at our workshop poster for more details.
