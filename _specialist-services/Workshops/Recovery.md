Recovery, the often forgotten element that is key to adaptation and improvement in performance!  

While some recovery methods are easily accessible and cost-free such as sleeping and stretching, some do require specialized equipment such as a foam roller or ice-bath with controlled temperature setting.  This hands-on workshop on foam rolling for recovery can be helpful for any athlete to hasten the recovery process for muscle groups that had been working really hard for them during training/ competition.  

Find out more about possible sites that you may apply foam rolling to in the workshop poster. [](/files/workshops-by-tp/Sports%20Leaders%20Workshop%202021_Recovery.pdf)

In addition, a sharing on recovery and periodisation by Physioconnect@Lakeside Pte Ltd may be of interest to you if you are keen to learn more about different recovery methods and gain some practical tips on managing training load.
