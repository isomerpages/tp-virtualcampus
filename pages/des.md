### Mural Displays in DES ###
As part of the School of Design’s 30th anniversary, various renowned alumni designers/artists were invited to showcase their creativity and leave their imprint on the walls in TP!

These fun and quirky designs now adorn several nooks and crannies of the DES building, and are bound to brighten up your day with their psychedelic display of colours, icons and motifs. The project features multi-faceted artist, Stanley Lau [(@artgerm)](https://www.instagram.com/artgerm/), known for his work on Marvel, DC Comics and Capcom; and art director, Muneera Malek [(@moon_malek)](https://www.instagram.com/moon_malek/) – amongst other prominent DES alumni. 

The next time you swing by DES, remember to pose for your #OOTDs against these lovely murals!

### “Very Momentary Exhibition 1.5” by Lee Wei Lieh ###
DES alumnus/adjunct and installation artist, Lee Wei Lieh (1998), recently staged a successful series of pop-up exhibitions at various HDB void decks, lighting up the ubiquitous heartlands that we know and love so well with his unique brand of artistic flair and creativity!

Titled “Very Momentary Exhibition 1.5”, these transient installations were inspired by the concept of ephemeral rainbows in the sky. Wei Lieh’s works have also been showcased at the Singapore Night Festival, i-Light Marina Bay and Noise Singapore, as well as Very Small Exhibition, an artistic collective that he co-founded.
