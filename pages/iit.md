### Sharing of Student Experiences by IIT Alumni ###
Two alumni from the Class of 2020 – Ezekiel Ghe (Business Intelligence & Analytics) and Rimshaa Irfan (Big Data Management & Governance) – were invited to share their TP experiences with current IIT students in May 2020. They touched on their learning journeys through overseas study trips, certification programmes, competitions and internships. At the sharing, Ezekiel and Rimshaa also shared many useful tips and insights on how to better manage the academic workload, as well as the different opportunities available for students when they graduate. 

It was definitely an enriching and inspiring session for the students, and a heartwarming way for our alumni to contribute back to the school!
