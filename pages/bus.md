### BUS Alumni @ Singapore Food Festival 2020 ###
The inaugural virtual edition of the Singapore Food Festival (SFF) was held from 21-30 August 2020. Conducted over two weekends, this showcase of gastronomic delights featured live masterclasses, curated food bundles, and interactive food tours for everyone to enjoy in the comfort of their homes.

We are proud of the co-founders of [Kausmo](https://www.instagram.com/kausmosg/?hl=en) – Lisa Tang and Kuah Chew Shian – who showcased their culinary prowess at a masterclass (23 August 2020) featuring a dish created with the rarely-used local Patin fish! Both Lisa (2015) and Chew Shian (2016) were fellow graduates from the Diploma in Culinary and Catering Management. 

This was definitely a delectable session not to be missed. Check out the masterclass video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=6Tyn4Wp7bG8)!
