### Sharing by MTN Alumnus ###
The Diploma in Mechatronics (MTN) welcomed alumnus Ronnie Gan (1995) at a webinar held on 27 January 2021, which was attended by the graduating cohort of students. 

Currently the Head of Business Development at Siemens Pte Ltd (Smart Infrastructure), Ronnie shared many invaluable tips and advice with our students, especially at this critical juncture of their lives as they prepare to transit from polytechnic to the workplace/university. They also gleaned useful insights on Ronnie’s successes, failures and lessons learnt, as well as his attitude towards work and the community. 

We hope our students will be inspired by Ronnie and work equally hard to realise their own dreams in future!

### Sharing by AMS Alumni ###
Held on 25 January 2021, six alumni speakers from the Diploma in Aviation Management (AMS) were invited to share on the theme of “Life After AMS” at this webinar, which was attended by the graduating cohort of students. 

During this session, the speakers shared about the career prospects and different pathways available for AMS graduates. Our students also received many tips and advice on how to prepare themselves for a career in the fast-paced aviation industry, as well as useful ways of circumventing work challenges – especially when the going gets tough.

We hope our Class of 2021 graduates have learnt a thing or two from their seniors, and wish them all the best in their future endeavours!
