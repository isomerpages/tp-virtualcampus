![TPCCAScholarship2022](/images/TP CCA Scholarship 2022 Banner.png)

The annual CCA Scholarships are awarded to students who have contributed significantly to CCAs in the Polytechnic.

2021 has been a continuation of an unprecedented year, when COVID-19 first struck Singapore. However, despite the many curveballs thrown by the pandemic, our students have remained resilient and positive, made significant efforts to keep their CCA groups alive, and devised creative workarounds in ways previously unimaginable. In the process, they were also engaged and exposed to new skills and learning opportunities.
