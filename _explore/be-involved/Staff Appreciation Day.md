## TP Celebrates Staff Appreciation Day on 5 Nov 2021

Together with the entire Poly-ITE community, TP celebrated the 2nd Staff Appreciation Day through a LIVE radio show where our students and staff expressed their appreciation to educators and the non-academic staff for the care, guidance, and unwavering support that they have received during their education journey in TP. You can read all the appreciation messages that have been posted in this [link](https://padlet.com/rysechan/f64oomokla8p3gyf) and recap parts of the radio show here as our PCEO Peter Lam joined us LIVE to share his personal greetings with all staff.
