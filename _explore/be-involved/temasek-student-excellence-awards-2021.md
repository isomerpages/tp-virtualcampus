### Temasek Student Excellence Awards 2021

Heartiest congratulations to all our recipients of the **Temasek Student Excellence Awards (TSEA) 2021**!

The TSEA are presented annually to recognise the outstanding contributions of students in non-academic areas, such as arts, sports, leadership, service, entrepreneurship and character excellence. While 2020 has been an unprecedented year, our students have remained resilient and positive, made significant efforts to keep our campus vibrant, and devised creative workarounds in ways previously unimaginable. They were also quick to adapt and agile enough to continue a legacy of excellence, despite the curveballs thrown by the pandemic.

This year, we honour <u>**259 students**</u> across the Higher Award categories (Individual and Group/Team). In addition, <u>**1,549 students**</u> will receive the CCA Dedication Awards.

Letâ€™s salute them for their sacrifice, strength and spirit. Join us at the Award Ceremony and celebrate virtually with our deserving recipients from across all of TP!

Date: 25 September 2021 (Saturday)
