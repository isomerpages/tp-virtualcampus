### Temasek Student Excellence Awards 2021

The Temasek Student Excellence Awards (TSEA) are presented annually to recognise the inspiring achievements and outstanding contributions of students in non-academic areas, such as arts, sports, leadership, service, entrepreneurship and character excellence.

2020 has been an unprecedented year for our students and CCA groups. However, despite the curveballs that the pandemic has thrown, they have remained resilient and positive, made significant efforts to keep their CCA groups alive, and devised creative workarounds in ways previously unimaginable. In the process, they were also engaged and exposed to new skills and learning opportunities. 

In view of the COVID-19 situation, the TSEA Secretariat has modified some of our usual award categories to facilitate your nominations. Nonetheless, the spirit of TSEA remains in celebrating excellent student contributions. 

<b>Announcement</b><br>
Nominations for the TSEA are now closed. Thank you for your active support in nominating deserving students who have made a difference despite all the odds! Results will be released by September 2021, so do watch this space for more updates.
