### Temasek Student Excellence Awards 2022

The Temasek Student Excellence Awards (TSEA) are presented annually to recognise the inspiring achievements and outstanding contributions of students in non-academic areas, such as the arts, sports, leadership, service, entrepreneurship and character excellence.

2021 has been a continuation of an unprecedented year, when COVID-19 first struck Singapore. However, despite the many curveballs thrown by the pandemic, our students have remained resilient and positive, made significant efforts to keep their CCA groups alive, and devised creative workarounds in ways previously unimaginable. In the process, they were also engaged and exposed to new skills and learning opportunities. 

Do take a moment to uplift your students' spirits, and give them a pat on the back for their amazing dedication, selfless sacrifice and inspiring leadership.

Nominate them for the TSEA today!
