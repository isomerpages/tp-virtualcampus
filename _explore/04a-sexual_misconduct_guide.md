### Sexual Misconduct Support Guide

![Listen II]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BeCaring-Sexualmisconduct.png)

No one expects to meet with sexual misconduct incidents. Unfortunately, such incidents do happen sometimes. Student Support & Career Services has recently developed this guide as a resource to students in TP. 

This guide also includes some information for peers to support peers who have experienced a sexual misconduct incident. 

You may find this resource [here](https://github.com/isomerpages/tp-vc/raw/staging/images/attachment/TP_Sexual_Misconduct_Guide_For_Students.pdf)
