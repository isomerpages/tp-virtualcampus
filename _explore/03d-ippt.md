# IPPT Training Resources

If you are medically graded PES A or B1, you will enjoy an 8-week reduction in your full-time NS duration if you attain 61 points or more from the three Pre-Enlistee IPPT stations (with a minimum of 1 point from each station). Otherwise, you are required to undergo an additional 8-week Physical Training Phase (PTP) enlistment. 

The Student Development & Alumni Affairs (SDAA) Department has designed a 4-week training programme to beast it up in your IPPT! Go hard or go home!
