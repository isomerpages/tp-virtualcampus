### Sexual Misconduct Support Guide

![Misconduct](/images/BeCaring-Sexualmisconduct.png)

No one expects to meet with sexual misconduct incidents. Unfortunately, such incidents do happen sometimes. Student Support & Career Services has recently developed this guide as a resource to students in TP.

This guide also includes some information for peers to support peers who have experienced a sexual misconduct incident.

You may find this resource [here](/files/TP_Sexual_Misconduct_Guide_For_Students.pdf).
