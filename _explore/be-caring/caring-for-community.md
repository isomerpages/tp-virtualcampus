### Adopt A Block

**What is the project about?**

Adopt a Block is a CSC organized event where we visited a rental block and distributed care packs consisting of items such as face masks, food items, dishwashing liquid, wet wipes among other essential items. The objectives of the project are as follows:

1. To provide basic necessities and improve the living conditions of needy beneficiaries who are currently living in rental flats. Examples of such donation items include face masks, tissue packs and food items.
2. To provide more meaningful volunteering opportunities for the TP student population and hence develop a sense of volunteerism in the students.
3. To create opportunities to allow volunteers to experience and bring smiles to the beneficiaries during the festive season.
4. To establish and build community partnerships with voluntary welfare organizations.

In total, we had 10 volunteers who helped in the distribution and around 100-150 beneficiaries, within the distribution block, managed to receive the donation items.

**Project Impact**

We managed to achieve the intended objectives and successfully impacted the beneficiaries by providing them an opportunity to receive such essential items, which they may otherwise be unable to gain access to, due to financial issues or otherwise. This event would thus definitely improve the overall living standards of the beneficiaries.

Additionally, we managed to successfully provide a meaningful volunteering opportunity for the TP student volunteers, who were able to bring joy to the less fortunate, especially in the season of giving.

### Hello My Grandfriend

**What is the project about? Project Objectives, Number of Volunteers, and Beneficiaries?**

In collaboration with Sree Narayana Mission Nursing Home, “Hello My Grandfriend” is a tele-befriending project where the aim is to provide companionship and cognitive engagement for the elderly residing there. The highest number of our volunteers who signed up for this interactive programme is a whopping 20! Over eight sessions, 20 of them have impacted 10 seniors!

**So What: Why and how did the project impact the beneficiaries and volunteers?**

Companionship and cognitive engagement were provided because we were able to cater to their needs by engaging in something manageable for them. Chatting with the elderly is something we enjoyed. We managed to overcome the challenge of engaging them in online activities. Overall, it was a beneficial experience for us. Over eight sessions, 20 of our volunteers have impacted 10 seniors! The number may seem small, but the learning and memories gained were beyond comparison. The volunteers took away a new learning experience of tele-befriending. They can be more confident in volunteering in more modes!

**Now What: Any follow-up for the projects?**

As the academic year progresses, we are running this programme into the third tranche! This shows our positive relations we have established with Sree Narayana Mission Nursing Home. We will consider continuing our partnership with them in the next academic year if our resources permit.

### Humans of TP

TP CSC is organizing our first instalment of “Humans of TP”. Its objectives are to allow fellow students to show their heartfelt appreciations towards the migrant worker friends by doing a friendly interview with them, which showcases the migrant worker in a different light. Furthermore, by understanding their situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, our fellow students would be able to show support towards them and foster strong relationships with them. This project involved six helpful volunteers, who stepped up courageously to interact with the migrant workers, and they got along really quickly with them and beneficiaries include Migrant worker centre (MWC).

This project positively impacted MWC and the volunteers because aligning with MWC’s thrusts, FAIR, TP CSC is helping the migrant workers by allowing our volunteers to interact individually with the migrant workers in the breakout rooms, to be able to have a friendly chat with the distressed workers, so that we alleviate their sufferings or loneliness as seen from one of their thrusts, A, which stands for assistance. The migrant workers would be more socially integrated into society, as they slowly open up to share their experiences with the volunteers.

Simultaneously, volunteers are also positively impacted as we are more aware of the situations the migrant workers face during COVID-19, so we would be more connected with the migrant worker and easily relate their experiences with what is happening now. We are also able to adopt a caring heart where we show appreciation towards migrant workers for working so hard.
The follow up for this project is social media postings and doing write-ups of the migrant workers, to allow us to further show appreciation towards the migrant workers for their contributions towards Singapore!

### Mentoring Programme

**What is the project about?**

CSC’s Mentoring Programmes, consisting of YEAH Programme and Enlighten Mentoring Programme, partners with external non-profit organizations (NPOs) where student volunteers tutor, guide and act as mentors for children from such NPOs. The objectives of the project are as follows:

1. To build a strong base of volunteers and cultivate volunteerism in TP through weekly volunteer work.
2. To establish and build community partnerships with People’s Association and non-profit organizations such as Unity Movement Ltd and Singapore Buddhist Lodge.
3. To gain an understanding of the needs of these students and learn how to motivate them to see life as a meaningful journey.

In total, we have around 50 student volunteers and 43 beneficiaries, consisting of primary school children aged 9-12 years old.  

**Project Impact**

The project has successfully impacted both beneficiaries and volunteers. Beneficiaries have managed to receive guidance from a mentor who can continue to mold him/her into someone who can accomplish their goals both academically as well as in their character development.

Similarly, through this project, we managed to build a strong volunteer pool where volunteers got the opportunity to get a better understanding as to the issues that many latch-keyed children face and how they can better provide aid to kids in such cases.

**Follow up for the project**

As the 2 mentoring programmes are ongoing events, they will continue taking place throughout the new year, at least until the end of the 2022 academic year.

### Special Needs Cluster

#### Project This Ability
**Project Objectives:**
1. To allow our volunteers to be able to deepen their understanding of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs)
2. To provide the clients with a platform to interact with a new group of volunteers from a different demographic
3. To equip our volunteers with the necessary skills to respectfully communicate and interact with people with special needs
4. To enable volunteers to step out of their comfort zone and successfully facilitate the activity sessions

Number of volunteers: 9  
Number of beneficiaries: 100

**Why and how did the project impact the beneficiaries and volunteers**

Beneficiaries: Some of the activities planned for the clients are games such as bingo, or Guess what games! Other activities also include arts and craft, as well as song and dance sessions for a great workout! Consequently, with the help of our volunteers, they were able to engage in more stimulating activities. Through the different activities planned, their bodies and minds are kept active.

Volunteers: Volunteers are given a platform to interact with Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (PWIDs). The carrying out of activities for each session also allows a volunteer to step out of their comfort zone in order to ensure that the activities are engaging enough for the clients. Through hosting the various activities, they are also given opportunities to learn how to interact with PWIDs. Additionally, through our dry runs, volunteers were given the opportunity to bond and befriend each other. This also in turn improves the rapport between them to carry out a successful session for the clients at MINDS.

**Continuation of Project**

Project This Ability will see its continuation of its third run in Term 4. Project This Ability may hopefully stand the chance of conducting its third run face-to-face (entirely dependent on the Covid-19 situation). However, please be rest assured that Project This Ability will be here to stay in Temasek Polytechnic’s Community Service Club as a long-term volunteering project. Therefore, be it virtual or physical, do keep a lookout when we call for volunteers!

#### Sign With Me
**What is the project about (Project objectives, number of volunteers and beneficiaries):**

1. To allow our volunteers to deepen their understanding of the challenges that persons with hearing disabilities face in everyday life.
2. To provide the volunteers with an avenue to learn the basics of how to interact with persons with hearing disabilities.
3. To equip our volunteers with the necessary skills to respectfully communicate and interact with people with special needs.

Number of Volunteers: 60  
Beneficiaries: NIL

**So What: Why and how did the project impact the beneficiaries and volunteers**

Volunteers: During the Sign with Me workshop, some information disseminated were terms used by the deaf community, manual alphabet and numbers and a lot more. Through this workshop, volunteers managed to clear up any misconceptions they may have on the deaf community. The workshop was an educational one as they managed to pick up some Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) and even win prizes through the various quizzes!

**Now What: Any follow up for the projects**

This workshop will be conducted again as our volunteers were very receptive and had a lot of fun attending this workshop. We may be considering to lengthen this one-day workshop to a full-fledged sign language course, so do keep a lookout for that if it happens!

### Walk For Rice

**Project Objectives**

The project objectives for Walk For Rice is to instill a giving spirit and cultivate a caring culture in Temasek Polytechnic by encouraging students and staff to walk for a good cause and to spread the spirit of giving amongst their peers. As well as to strengthen community partnership with South East CDC to promote the spirit of volunteerism.

**Impact of the project: Number of volunteers/ beneficiaries, impact on both volunteers and beneficiaries (can be reflections/ feedback**

The impact of this project was that there is a total number of 367 participants from Temasek Polytechnic (consisting of students and staff) that walk/run a total distance of 6937.74km. This was way higher than last year’s walk for rice which was a total distance of 2647.71km. This means that the number of rice bowls raised for the beneficiaries has increased significantly as compared to last year. This allows the volunteers to understand that every little effort counts in the event and ultimately the beneficiaries will be able to enjoy the food items that were raised by the volunteers.

**Any follow up of the project**
After the walk for rice event, there was supposed to be a follow-up event partnering with South-East CDC to allow volunteers to personally deliver the food items raised to the beneficiaries’ homes. To allow volunteers to understand how their effort really helps the beneficiaries. However, due to the Covid-19 situation, to ensure the safety of both parties, it was unfortunately cancelled.

### Virtual Walk For Rice @ TP ###

[TP CSC](/p10/csc/) supported South East CDC with a virtual "Walk for Rice @ TP" in the month of Dec 2020. This campaign encourages our TP Community to give back during the season of giving by walking for a good cause. For every 300m achieved, South East CDC's NTUC Fairprice donated 1 bowl of white rice, 1 bowl of brown rice, and 1 bowl of instant oatmeal to needy families in the South East District.

In total, TP Community collectively clocked in 2,647,71km which translated to 8,825 bowls of white rice, 8,825 bowls of brown rice and 8,825 bowls of instant oatmeal. Thank you to all who have contributed to this good cause.
