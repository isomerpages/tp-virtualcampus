### Adopt A Block

Adopt a Block is a CSC organized event where we visited a rental block and distributed care packs consisting of items such as face masks, food items, dishwashing liquid, wet wipes among other essential items. The objectives of the project are as follows: 

1. To provide basic necessities and improve the living conditions of the residents
2. To provide meaningful volunteering opportunities for the TP student population
3. To build relationships with the residents of the rental block.

A total of 64 staff and students donated items, with 10 volunteers who helped in the distribution and around 100-150 beneficiaries, within the distribution block, managed to receive the donation items, which they may otherwise be unable to gain access to, due to financial issues or otherwise. Overall, it was a meaningful experience for the volunteers and the beneficiaries.
