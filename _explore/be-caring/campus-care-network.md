Established in 1991, [Campus Care Network (CCN)](https://www.tp.edu.sg/life-at-tp/a-caring-campus.html#campus-care-network){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} has been instrumental in developing personal contact and rapport between lecturers and students, creating a family-like environment, and maintaining a caring culture so as to ensure students' personal growth.

TP's inaugural Virtual Campus Care Network Day held in August 2020, in conjunction with TP National Day Virtual Concert was meant to raise funds for our needy students especially during this current pandemic. <br>
