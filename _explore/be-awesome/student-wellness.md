## <a id="TPPSiA"></a>TP PSiA 
Student Care is happy to introduce the formation of PSiA [Peer Supporters in-Action], a new student interest group. This team of dedicated students came together with a common goal to create better awareness of the importance of mental health issues faced by the students.           

They hope to help create a safe and supportive environment in TP where students feel secure and comfortable sharing their experiences with one another. More details and activities can be found at IG at tp.psia [https://www.instagram.com/tp.psia/](https://www.instagram.com/tp.psia/)

Check out the latest series of interviews with all TP counsellors via the IG too.
