Lace up your shoes, we are back! TP will be partnering with North-East Community Development Council (NECDC) to organise the TP-NECDC Virtual Challenge 2021.

This year’s Virtual Challenge is a flexible and convenient event where you can run, walk or even cycle at your own pace and space. 

You can also do it alone or **with a family member or friend** (not more than 2!). 

**Your $5 participation fee will go entirely to the TP Campus Care Network (CCN) Fund which provides financial aid to TP needy students**. 

In addition, NECDC will match the total amount of entry fee collected from the participants. Complete the distance within the race period and earn attractive race entitlements (exclusive finisher tee, microfiber sports towel & e-certificate) while helping out for a good cause.

Don’t miss this unique opportunity to contribute to TP CCN and get fit in the process. Sign up **now** by scanning the QR codes or simply click the links below:
