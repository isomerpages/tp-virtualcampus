# IPPT Training Resources

If you are medically graded PES A or B1, enjoy an additional 8 weeks of freedom if you attain 61 points or more from the three Pre-Enlistees IPPT stations (with a minimum 1 point from each station).

The Student Development & Alumni Affairs (SDAA) Department has designed a 4-week training programme to beast it up in your IPPT! Go hard or go home!

### IPPT Exemption
If you are medically graded PES B (except B1), C or E, you are not required to take the Pre-Enlistee IPPT as you go through a modified basic training programme. Thus, you do not qualify for the 8-week reduction in your full-time NS duration.

Submit your [IPPT exemption](https://forms.office.com/r/rBsU2iBk0H).
