<p>TP Sports Club (TPSC) is a non-academic constituent club that is committed
to bringing about a vibrant campus, fostering a healthy lifestyle and community
bonding through a wide array of physical activities. TPSC believes in learning
through sports and aims to empower all students through inclusive activities
specially curated by the club.
<br>
<br>Collaborating with other Constituent clubs, we organised the "<strong>TP Walk for Rice 2024</strong>",
where we featured exciting carnival games and prizes to liven up the mood
for both students and the community. We also had a fundraiser, "<strong>Sportopia</strong>",
in collaboration with the TP Campus Care Network to raise funds for students
through gamified sports. Along with SENvocates, we also rolled out a service
learning event, "<strong>SEN Awareness Campaign - TParalympia</strong>".
We have continued its effort to introduce the world of para-sports to the
TP community and public, instilling the value of inclusivity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Come join us now and let's bring a change to TP together!
