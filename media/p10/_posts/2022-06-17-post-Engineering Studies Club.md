<p>The Engineering Studies Club (ESC) is the nerve centre of student life
in the School of Engineering, and each year, its group of student leaders
takes the lead to plan and organise school-wide events for all Engineering
students. These include the ENG Leadership Training Camp, E-Guides Training
Camp, Mentors Training Camp, the annual Freshmen Orientation and Temasek
Polytechnicâ€™s Open House.
<br>
<br>Apart from school-wide events, ESC also focuses on students' well-being,
spearheading a myriad of fun-filled activities and injecting vibrancy to
the School of Engineering. Through these activities, the Club provides
Engineering students with an avenue to serve, as well as offers a platform
to showcase their talents and an incubator for new ideas.
