                   Engineering Studies Club (ESC) is the nerve centre of student life in the School of Engineering, and each year, its group of student leaders takes the lead to plan and organise school-wide events for all Engineering students. These include the ENG Leadership Training Camp, E-Guides Training Camp, Mentors Training Camp, the annual Freshmen Orientation and Temasek Polytechnicâ€™s Open House.
									<br><br>
									Apart from school-wide events, ESC also focuses on students' well-being, spearheading a myriad of fun-filled activities and injecting vibrancy to the School of Engineering.  Through these activities, the Club provides Engineering students with an avenue to serve, as well as offers a platform to showcase their talents and an incubator for new ideas.
