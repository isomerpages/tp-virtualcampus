<p>Handball is a team sport in which two teams of six outcourt players and
one goalkeeper pass the ball around with the objective of throwing it into
the goal of the opposing team. The game consists of two halves of 30 minutes
each and the team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match.
The TP Handball Team (Men) competes in external competitions annually.
