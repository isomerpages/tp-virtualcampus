<p>Developed in Scandinavia in the 1970s, floorball is a fast-paced sport
played indoors with ’plastic’ sticks and a ball. Playing the stick above
the waist is also against the rules, making it a relatively safe sport.
Each game comprises three periods of 15 minutes and involves five players
and a goalkeeper with rotating substitutions. TP Floorball teams (Men &amp;
Women) compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic
(IVP) Floorball Games annually.
