<p>Developed in Scandinavia in the 1970s, floorball is a fast-paced sport
played indoors with ’plastic’ sticks and a ball. Playing the stick above
the waist is against the rules, making it a relatively safe sport. Each
game comprises three periods of 15 minutes and involves five players and
a goalkeeper with rotating substitutions. The TP Floorball Teams (Men &amp;
Women) compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic
(IVP) Floorball Games annually.
