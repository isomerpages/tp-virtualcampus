                Originating from China, dragon boat racing is a human-powered boat sport. For competitive events, dragon boats are generally rigged with decorative and colorful Chinese dragon heads and tails. In races, there are 20 people in a standard boat, and 10 in a small boat, excluding steersperson and the drummer. The dragon boat races are the highlight of the Week Zero activities in our annual Temasek Polytechnic Regatta. TP Dragon Boat Teams (Men &amp; Women) compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Dragon Boat Race and external competitions annually.<br>
