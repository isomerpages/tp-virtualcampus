<p>Originating from China, dragon boat racing is a human-powered boat sport.
For competitive events, dragon boats are generally rigged with decorative
and colorful Chinese dragon heads and tails. In races, there are 20 people
in a standard boat and 10 in a small boat, excluding the steersperson and
drummer. The dragon boat races are the highlight of the Freshmen Orientation
(Week Zero) activities in our annual Temasek Polytechnic Regatta. The TP
Dragon Boat Teams (Men &amp; Women) compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE)
Dragon Boat Race and external competitions annually.
