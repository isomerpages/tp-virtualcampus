<p>Rugby is an intense and physical sport, requiring its players to be robust
and resilient. With the traditional 15-a-side game, the aim is to score
more points than the opposition team by carrying, kicking and passing the
ball. In recent years, the sport has been injected with more action and
exhilaration through the 7-a-side game. Every year, TP Rugby Team competes
in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Rugby Games (15s). With its physicality,
competitiveness and strategic play, rugby is truly an exhilarating sport
to behold.
