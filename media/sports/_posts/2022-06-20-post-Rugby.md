<p>Rugby is a demanding and physical sport that calls for players to be tough
and resilient. In the traditional 15-a-side format, the goal is to outscore
the opposing team by carrying, kicking and passing the ball. In recent
years, the 7-a-side version has brought even more action and excitement
to the game. Each year, the TP Rugby Team competes in the Polytechnic-ITE
(POL-ITE) Rugby Games (15s). With its high intensity, competitive spirit,
and strategic play, rugby is truly a thrilling sport to watch and play.
