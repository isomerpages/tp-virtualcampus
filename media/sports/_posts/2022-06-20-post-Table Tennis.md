<p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong, is another familiar sport in Singapore.
Play is fast and demands quick reactions and movements, making it an exciting
sport to watch as well. TP Table Tennis Teams (Men &amp; Women) compete
in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP)
Table-Tennis Games annually.
