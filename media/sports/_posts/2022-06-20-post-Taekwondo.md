<p>Taekwondo is the oldest Korean martial art and is still included in the
Korean military training today. Taekwondo competitions involve poomsae,
a set of defined pattern defence and attack techniques, and kyorugi, which
involves sparring with an opponent. The TP Taekwondo Team competes in the
Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Taekwondo Games and external competitions annually.
