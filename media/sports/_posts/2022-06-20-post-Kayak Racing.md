<p>Kayak racing is a water sport growing in popularity. The first kayaks
were made of driftwood and animal skins by the natives of Asia and North
America. Modern kayaks are made of metal, fiberglass and rubber, making
them stronger, more durable and portable. The TP Kayak Racing Teams (Men
&amp; Women) compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Canoe Sprints and
external competitions annually.
