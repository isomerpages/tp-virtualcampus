<p>Lifesaving is a unique sport, where the skills are developed primarily
for humanitarian purposes and applied for competition. The sport provides
a platform for lifeguards to come together to develop their skills in drowning
prevention and attending to water-related injuries. It involves a myriad
of simulated scenarios such as swimming to a submerged manikin, bringing
the manikin to the surface and swimming to the edge of the pool. To get
involved in the sport, a person needs a Bronze Medallion certification.
