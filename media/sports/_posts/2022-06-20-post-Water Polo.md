<p>Water Polo is a physically demanding team water sport played over 4 quarters,
consisting of two teams of 6 field players and 1 goalkeeper each. Gameplay
involves swimming, handling and passing the ball, and players score by
throwing the ball into the goal defended by a goalkeeper. The TP Water
Polo Team competes in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Water Polo Games annually.
