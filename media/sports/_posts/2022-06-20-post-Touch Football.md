<p>Touch Football, also known as Touch Rugby, is gaining popularity among
young men and women in Singapore. Played with two teams of six players,
the game involves players using their hands to touch opponents on any part
of the body, clothing or ball, rather than engaging in traditional tackles.
The rules are simple and easy to grasp, making it a safe and accessible
alternative to more physical contact sports. At TP, Touch Football is exclusively
for females, and the team competes annually in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE)
and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP) Touch Football Games.
