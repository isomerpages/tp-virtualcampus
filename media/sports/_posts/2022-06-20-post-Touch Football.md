<p>Touch Football, or Touch Rugby as it is sometimes known, is an increasingly
popular sport amongst young men and women in Singapore. The game is played
with two teams of six players and requires players to use their hands to
touch their opponents on any part of the body, clothing or the ball, instead
of tackling in the traditional physical way. The rules of the game are
simple and straightforward, making it easy to learn and a safe alternative
to traditional physical contact sports. Touch Football in TP is only for
females and the team competes in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity
Polytechnic (IVP) Touch Football Games annually.
