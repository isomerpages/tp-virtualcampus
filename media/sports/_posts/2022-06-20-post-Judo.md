<p>Judo is a combat martial art founded in Japan and has evolved into an
Olympic sport. Two judo practitioners, also known as Judoka, will step
into a combat ring with the objective of throwing or taking down the opponent,
immobilise an opponent with a pin or force an opponent into submission
with a choke or joint lock. The TP Judo Team competes in external competitions
annually.
