<p>Karate is a martial art developed in Japan under the influence of Chinese
Kung Fu. A karate practitioner is called a karateka and the aim is to master
the art of punching, kicking, knee strikes, elbow strikes and open-hand
techniques such as knife-hands, palm-heel hands and spear hands. The TP
Karate Team competes in external competitions annually.
