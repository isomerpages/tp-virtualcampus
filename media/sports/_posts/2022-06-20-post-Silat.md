<p>Silat is an ancient form of martial arts originating from Southeast Asia.
It is an impressive performance that combines powerful strikes with intricate
joint manipulation techniques. Recently, UNESCO has recognised Silat as
an important part of the intangible cultural heritage of the region. The
TP Silat team is proud to represent this cherished martial art annually
in external competitions, most notably the IVP Silat competition organised
by the Singapore Silat Federation, in both the Seni and Tanding categories.
