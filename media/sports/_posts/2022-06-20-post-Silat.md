<p>Silat is a traditional martial art that originated in Southeast Asia,
known for its dynamic combination of powerful strikes and intricate joint
manipulation techniques. Recently, UNESCO acknowledged Silat as a significant
part of the region's intangible cultural heritage. The TP Silat team takes
great pride in representing this esteemed martial art in external competitions
each year, particularly the IVP Silat competition organised by the Singapore
Silat Federation, competing in both the Seni and Tanding categories.</p>
