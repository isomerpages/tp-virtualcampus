<p>Swimming is the second most popular exercise activity in Singapore and
is one of the most popular Olympic sports. It requires the use of one's
entire body to move through water. For competition, the swimming events
generally consists of butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle and
individual medley. Swimming is good for physical health as it burns lots
of calories, is easy on the joints, supports your weight, builds muscular
strength and endurance. TP Swimming teams (Men &amp; Women) compete in
the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP) Swimming
Championship annually.
