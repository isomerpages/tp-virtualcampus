<p>Netball is a popular ball sport played by two teams of seven players each.
The objective of the game is for teams to score by shooting into the goal
ring. Unique to the game, players are assigned specific roles and move
around within the restricted areas on court to maintain or gain possession
of the ball. The TP Netball Team competes in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE)
Games and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP) Games annually.
