<p>Volleyball is played by two teams of six players, separated by a net.
By grounding a ball on the other team's court, each team tries to score
points. The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players
can contact the ball with any part of the body. Techniques used in volleyball
include spiking and blocking, passing, setting, and specialised player
positions and offensive and defensive structures. TP Volleyball (Men &amp;
Women) teams compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity
Polytechnic (IVP) Volleyball Games annually.
