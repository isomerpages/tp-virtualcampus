<p>TP offers an exhilarating and unique opportunity for its students to participate
in sport climbing as a CCA. It is an indoor form of rock climbing, which
does not require the use of ropes or harnesses, and instead relies on the
climbersâ€™ agility and strength. With the help of their coaches, students
can learn the art of bouldering and hone their skillset. The TP Sport Climbing
team competes in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Sport Climbing (Bouldering)
Championship annually, which provides them with the opportunity to showcase
their talents and gain the recognition they deserve.
