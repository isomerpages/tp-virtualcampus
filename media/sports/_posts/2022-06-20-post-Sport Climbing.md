<p>TP provides an exciting and unique opportunity for students to engage
in sport climbing as a CCA. This indoor form of rock climbing does not
require ropes or harnesses, relying instead on the climbers' agility and
strength. With guidance from their coaches, students can master the art
of bouldering and refine their skills. The TP Sport Climbing team, which
includes both Men’s and Women’s, competes annually in the Polytechnic-ITE
(POL-ITE) Sport Climbing (Bouldering) Championship, giving them a chance
to showcase their talents and earn well-deserved recognition.
