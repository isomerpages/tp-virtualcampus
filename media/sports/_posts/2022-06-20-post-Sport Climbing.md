<p>TP provides an exciting and unique opportunity for students to engage
in sport climbing as a CCA. This indoor form of rock climbing does not
require ropes or harnesses, relying instead on the climbers' agility and
strength. With guidance from their coaches, students can master the art
of bouldering and refine their skills. The TP Sport Climbing Teams (Men
&amp; Women) compete annually in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Sport Climbing
(Bouldering) Championship, giving them a chance to showcase their talents
and earn well-deserved recognition.
