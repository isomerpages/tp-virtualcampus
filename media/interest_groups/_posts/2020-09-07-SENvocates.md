                    SENvocates is a CCA interest group dedicated to:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raising awareness / advocating for special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities</li>
                        <li>Participating in / organising disability-related events such as the Purple Parade</li>
                        <li>Providing peer support to fellow TP students with SEN</li>
                     </ul>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 Together with the SEN Support Division from Student Support & Career Services, we aim to foster a TP that is inclusive for all – where every TP student, regardless of one’s challenges, is empowered by the support of our SENvocates.<br>
                    <br>Don’t think of SENvocates as a group, think of us as your buddies!<br>
