                    The Fitness Through Science Interest Group's vision is to inspire, perspire and respire together, as we create an enjoyable fitness journey through science. Putting together our skills, knowledge and heart from the School of Applied Science (ASC), our mission is to inspire our fellow students and staff to embark on an active and healthy lifestyle journey in both the mental and physical faculties. Our club is formed by student leaders from ASC who embody the spirit of active living, while driving some of our initiatives such as IPPT training, Learn-a-sport, and ASC Healthy Lifestyle Week.<br>
