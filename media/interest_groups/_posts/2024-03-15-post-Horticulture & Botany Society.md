The Horticulture &amp; Botany Society is your gateway into learning and honing your skills with the care for plants. Established in 2022, we aim to make both horticulture and botanical sciences, and all in between free and accessible to the student body (and the community as an extension).<br>
<br>
While imparting skills such as seed germination, plant propagation, maintenance and plant art, we simultaneously aim to imbue the spirit of sustainability within members. Important causes include environmental conservation, repurposing and recycling materials, as well as reducing food waste.<br>
<br>
We also offer a wealth of opportunities for members to participate in outreach programmes outside campus and get to know people from various walks of life, under organisations such as National Parks (NParks), Peopleâ€™s Association and other grassroots organisations.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your skill level, there is a place for you here in this interest group!
