<p>The Peer Supporters-in-Action (PSiA) aims to equip students with the knowledge
about mental health and peer support skills so that anyone can be a supporter
to their fellow peers. PSiA also strives to provide a safe platform for
all students to feel comfortable about sharing their stories with one another.
Together with the Student Care team from Student Support &amp; Career Services,
activities and programmes are carried out to create a supportive environment
in TP and to raise awareness about mental health.
<br>
<br>Participating students can look forward to the following:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learn peer support skills to better support your friends and loved ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in/organise events, such as You've Got a Friend in Me Roadshow,
Beyond the Label campaign and World Mental Health Week, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make new friends in Friendly Friday sessions</p>
</li>
<li>
