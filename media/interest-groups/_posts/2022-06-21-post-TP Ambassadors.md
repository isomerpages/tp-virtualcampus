<p>As a TP Ambassador, you are an official student representative of Temasek
Polytechnic (TP). Your role is to boost visibility of the TP brand through
your interaction with the public and also your presence on social media
fronts. You will be an influencer and you will share and create TPâ€™s brand
with our online audience. You will be the face of TP and you will showcase
TP as a dynamic institution, ready to welcome students from all walks of
life. You will learn media production skills and be involved in content
creation projects to help drive engagement with our vibrant TP community.
You will, in essence, be trained to market TP to the rest of the world
