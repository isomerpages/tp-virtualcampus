<p>The TP-Institute of Public Relations of Singapore Student Chapter is an
industry-based interest group that seeks to create greater awareness of
public relations (PR) and the industry among TP students. We aim to equip
TP students with essential PR skills and provide opportunities for exposure
to the industry through mentorship programmes and talks.
<br>
<br><strong>Achievements:</strong>
<br>Our past three Presidents of the interest group won the PR Student of
the Year at the PRISM Awards, a well-recognised accolade in the PR industry.
We have also organised many industry events with leading PR practitioners
sharing their thoughts and opinions about the industry.
