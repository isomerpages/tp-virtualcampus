<p>The Design AI Interest Group aims to create a community of creative leaders
to spearhead the exploration of Generative AI in design, fostering cross-disciplinary
collaboration across five diploma courses - Communication Design, Digital
Film &amp; Television, Fashion Management &amp; Design, Interior Architecture,
and Product Experience Design. Through creative projects and knowledge
sharing, these future designers push the boundaries of creativity, integrating
AI-driven innovation into design practices, and inspiring their peers to
reimagine the future of design. This platform also serves as a creative
hive for experimentation, collaboration, and the advancement of AI applications
in the creative industry.</p>
