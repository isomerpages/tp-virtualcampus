<p>Engineering Makers Club (EMC) aims to develop creativity and spark an
interest in various areas of engineering among students and student maker
coaches, through various hands-on workshops and student-led interest projects
that impart essential engineering skills and DIY knowledge to participants.
EMC also conducts outreach activities and workshops to the general public
and secondary schools to spread awareness and interest in engineering.
<br>
<br>To equip members with the necessary skills, training is provided in a
wide range of areas such as, but not limited to, laser cutting, 3D modeling
and printing, as well as microbit programming. These skills will be helpful
in students' project work and even through their internship in their final
year.
