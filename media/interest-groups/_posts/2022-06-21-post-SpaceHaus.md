                    Spacehaus (previously known as "Project Innov8") focuses on providing students with the opportunities to learn design thinking-based skills and rapid prototyping, as well as enabling students to refine these skills in inter-disciplinary teams by working on various internal and industry projects. Members of Spacehaus will be able to fully utilise Makerspace+ in Temasek Launchpad, as well as get certified as a makercoach to teach and help other students with prototyping-based skills.            <br>
