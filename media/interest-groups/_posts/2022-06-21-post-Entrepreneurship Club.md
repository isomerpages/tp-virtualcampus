<p>The TP Entrepreneurship Club (TPEC) empowers members to develop entrepreneurial
skills through hands-on experiences. Our events, such as the inter-polytechnic
bazaar and workshops, allow members to navigate the challenges and rewards
of running a business, while showcasing their ventures to the TP community.
We also foster a spirit of volunteering and social entrepreneurship, as
seen in our TPEC x MINDS Christmas Event.</p>
<p>At TPEC, we value holistic development beyond entrepreneurship. We offer
a range of events, including Entresion workshops, business startup guides,
and educational visits to NUS Hangar. Our members have achieved notable
successes in competitions, such as the Asean Virtual Entrepreneurship Hackathon
2024, where our team won a bronze placing. We welcome individuals interested
in entrepreneurship to join our community and discover opportunities for
growth and development.</p>
