<p>The Temasek Polytechnic Entrepreneurship Club aims to provide a platform
to identify, nurture and groom students who possess interest and strength
in innovation and entrepreneurship (including social entrepreneurship).
Members will be expected to promote entrepreneurial mindset and organise
relevant activities such as talks, workshops, competitions, trips and events
for their TP peers and the community. Members will also have opportunities
to plan, execute and manage entreprenuerial-themed ventures.

<li>
<p>In 2023, TPEC organised an inter-poly networking event, Entresion #2:
Business Launch During Polytechnic Days, where the five polytechnics came
together to learn more about entrepreneurship and network with aspiring
entrepreneurs from different polytechnics. Students found this event beneficial
as they gained new insights from the panel discussion with founders and
co-founders of Asmara, Ezcompostr, and Oishii Daily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TPEC provided a platform for its members to showcase their entrepreneurship
skills by organising the TPEC Bazaar, enabling them to experience being
their own boss. Booth holders found this experience fulfilling as they
learned to balance costs and profits in running a business, while also
having opportunities to expose their businesses to the TP community. It
was truly an event created for students, by students!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than emphasising profits solely, TPEC instils members with a spirit
of volunteering and social entrepreneurship. This is evident through our
TPEC x MINDS Christmas Event, where MINDS trainees joined TPEC for a heartwarming
day of song and dance, celebrating the joy of togetherness. This has promoted
meaningful connections, inclusivity, and a sense of belonging among MINDS
participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TPEC sub-committees also organised wonderful events throughout the year,
providing opportunities for members to learn the ropes of running a business.
These events include the Resin Magic Workshop, where students learned how
to create and decorate a phone case using resin; Paws for a Cause, where
our sub-committees designed and sold cute animal keychains to support animals
by donating 50% of the project profits to the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA); and lastly, the Twilight event, where students
collaborated with TP Stargazers to put together a relaxing evening with
games, snacks, and telescopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides organising entrepreneurial events, TPEC also sends students for
competitions. In 2022, we witnessed teams (comprising Entrepreneurship
Group members) winning the gold and silver placings at the Asean Virtual
Entrepreneurship Hackathon 2022. This event was organised by the Passage
to Asean Association (P2A), which TP played the part of co-host.</p>
