<p>The iNNOVATE Committee aims to foster an entrepreneurial spirit and mindset
among students in the School of Business and TP. It develops entrepreneurship
capabilities by organising entrepreneurship events, webinars, workshops,
networking sessions with industry mentors and start-ups, as well as encouraging
members to participate in and organise hackathons.
