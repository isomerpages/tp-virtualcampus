<p>This is a dynamic group of TPians who has a passion to write and visually
represent their work. The styles of writing can be varied but working on
themes and building a writing dossier of dynamic work is the mission. There
are so many issues that confront our world. It is time for us to express
and exchange our thoughts and in this process, educate all on our concerns
so tomorrow will be brighter and better.
