<p>The Engineering Peer Mentors (EPM) are committed to serving both the school
and the community with compassion. Within the School of Engineering, EPM
organises the Learning Support Programme (LSP) by recruiting peer tutors
to assist students with their studies every Wednesday and Friday afternoon.
EPM also organises community service activities such as digitalisation
and craft workshops for non-profit organisations, and initiatives to help
the less privileged families in Tampines.
