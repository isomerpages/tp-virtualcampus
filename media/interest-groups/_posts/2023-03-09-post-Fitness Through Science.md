<p>The Fitness Through Science Interest Group's vision is to inspire, perspire
and respire together, as we create an enjoyable fitness journey through
science. Putting together our skills, knowledge and heart from the School
of Applied Science (ASC), our mission is to inspire our fellow students
and staff to embark on an active and healthy lifestyle journey in both
the mental and physical faculties. Our club is formed by student leaders
from ASC who embody the spirit of active living, while driving some of
our initiatives such as IPPT training, Learn-a-sport, and ASC Healthy Lifestyle
Week.
