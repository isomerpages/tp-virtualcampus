<p>Interested in gardening and plant care? The Horticulture &amp; Botany
society is the perfect fit you for you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Horticulture and Botany society aims to nuture our students' love
for plants and nature, teaching horticulture, the botanical sciences and
related areas to our student body and community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We regularly host workshops and sessions where members can gain hands-on
experience and help out in our community garden on campus. As a member,
these sessions will allow you to pick up skills such as seed germination,
plant propagation and composting. The workshops we organise also cover
areas such as terrarium-making, kokedama, microgreens and isopod care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, we also offer many opportunities for members to participate
in outreach programmes outside of campus to get to know people from various
walks of life, under organisations such as the National Parks Board, People's
Association and other grassroots organisations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regardless of your skill level, there is a place for you in this interest
group!</p>
