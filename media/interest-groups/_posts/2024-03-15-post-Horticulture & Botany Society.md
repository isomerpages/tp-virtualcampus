<p>The Horticulture &amp; Botany Society is your gateway into learning and
honing your skills with the care for plants. Established in 2022, we aim
to make both horticulture and botanical sciences, and all in between free
and accessible to the student body (and the community as an extension).
<br>
<br>While imparting skills such as seed germination, plant propagation, maintenance
and plant art, we simultaneously aim to imbue the spirit of sustainability
within members. Important causes include environmental conservation, repurposing
and recycling materials, as well as reducing food waste.
<br>
<br>We also offer a wealth of opportunities for members to participate in
outreach programmes outside campus and get to know people from various
walks of life, under organisations such as National Parks (NParks), Peopleâ€™s
Association and other grassroots organisations.
<br>
<br>Regardless of your skill level, there is a place for you here in this
interest group!
